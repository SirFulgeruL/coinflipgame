# Coinflip Game
I am a beginner in Python3 and decided to create a coinflip game.
In case there are people that also are learning python3 I tried to comment every line so you could understand what's going on in the script.

I know that probably there are ways to do it much better but like I said I am learning Python3.

If you have any suggestions for this project let me know.
